# An Honest (?) Comparison

Here we compare Secrecy with a number of apps marketed towards file hiding / file encrypting.

Our contestents:

| Details | Secrecy | Vaulty | Hide it Pro | Androignito |
|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Play Store | [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doplgangr.secrecy) | [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theronrogers.vaultyfree) | [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hideitpro) | [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codexapps.andrognito) |

## Contest Rounds
**Encryption Standard:**
What this app claims to encrypt users' files with, at least as stated in the app description.

**Open Source:**
If the app is open source, it implies that you(or any expert) can look at the source code and make sure it is not doing stealthy thing with your files under the hood.

**Hackable With:**
Is there any ways you can force somone else's files open?

**Unencrypted files:**
Does it encrypt each an every file, or does it only take the easy ones?

**Vaulty Recovery:**
It sets up a number of ways for users to open their vaults in case they forget their password.
*Adding a vault recovery method actually makes this app weaker. Imagine someone that knows you a lot and may be able to guess the answer of a recovery question, for instance.*

**Advanced plugin:**
Adds additional functionality to the app according to users' necessity.

**Development stage:**
Alpha means the app is still new-born. Beta means the app is somewhat ready, but should not be used on daily basis. Production means the app is ready for the market. It should do its job with out problem.
